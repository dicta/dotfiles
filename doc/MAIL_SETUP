This document outlines my current mail retrieval/reading setup. There are 
a fair number of moving parts here.

Major tools/packages:

- offlineimap: retrieves IMAP mail from remote servers, stores in local maildir

- notmuch: indexes all mail once received, provides search capability

- msmtp (with msmtpq): sends mail, with the ability to queue outbound mail
         when disconnected from the internet. Queue flushing is manual.

- mutt (personal fork): Mail reader. The version I use was forked from 
         mutt 1.5.21 with the addition of the "sidebar" patch and support
         for virtual folders being created from notmuch queries. All 
	 interaction with mail is through notmuch.

- alot: Mail reader. Currently testing this as a mutt replacement since
         it is written from the ground up for notmuch support and mutt's codebase
	 is not pretty & has some performance problems switching folders.

- gnome-keyring: used for password management when sending and retrieving email
         from remote servers. Specifically, I use the python bindings from msmtp 
	 and offlineimap for automated interaction, and the graphical client 
	 "seahorse" for administration.

My customized scripts:

- scripts/convert_mbox.py: Converts 'mbox' files into the maildir format supported
        by notmuch. This is primarily used for importing mailing list archives
	into notmuch for search and later retrieval.
